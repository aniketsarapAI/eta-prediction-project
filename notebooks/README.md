# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains development notebooks for data analysis and model training.

## Development Process

### Data Exploration & Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of 100k+ orders
- Geographic delivery pattern analysis
- Customer behavior and segmentation insights
- Product category performance analysis

### Model Development
- Feature engineering for delivery prediction
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Customer segmentation using RFM methodology
- Model validation and performance evaluation

### Key Findings
- 36% same-state vs 64% cross-state delivery split
- 7.2 day average difference in delivery times
- Customer segments with distinct behavioral patterns
- Seasonal delivery performance variations

## Model Training Results
- Delivery Prediction: MAE 4.5 days (13.6% improvement over baseline)
- Late Risk Classification: AUC 0.526 with balanced thresholds
- Customer Segmentation: 7 distinct segments identified

The trained models and preprocessing components are available in the `models/` directory.
